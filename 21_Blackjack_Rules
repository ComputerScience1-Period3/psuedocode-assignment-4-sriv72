OBJECT OF THE GAME
Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

THE DEAL
The dealer gives one card face up to each player in rotation clockwise.
Another round of cards is then dealt face up to each player.

NATURAL/BLACKJACK
If a player's first two cards are an ace and a "ten-card" (a picture card or 10),
giving him a count of 21 in two cards, this is a natural or "blackjack."

THE PLAY
The player to the left goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" 
(ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a player 
may stand on the two cards originally dealt him, or he may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, 
until he either decides to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). 
In the latter case, the player loses. The dealer then turns to the next player to his left and serves him in the same manner.
